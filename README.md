## Requirements

Please build a single HTML page displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice.

1. Do not spend more than 4 hours on your solution **(even if you do not complete the entire exercise)**.
2. Use the latest specs of HTML, CSS and ECMAScript to implement the solution. At this time, these would be HTML5, CSS3 and ES2016.
3. Use the [OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve the current 5 day weather forecast.
4. Give some thought to what will make a decent user experience. We would like to see something readable but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI elements.
5. Use any supporting technologies, frameworks, package managers, starter kits, build systems and libraries that you are familiar with and feel are appropriate.
6. Assuming a Node.js environment with the latest version installed, please ensure that there are **no globally
installed dependencies required** to build / run your app. If you have to have them please explain why.
This avoids environment issues when trying to build your solution.
7. Provide a README.md file that:
  - Documents how to run / build / test your creation.
  - Documents anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt, corrections etc).
8. **Submit** your code into a **public git repository** of your choice (github / bitbucket etc).
9. **Host** your code on a **public web server** of your choice.
